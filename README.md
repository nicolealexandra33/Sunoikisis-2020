# Sunoikisis-2020 
My name is Nicole, a new PhD student at the ICS studying 'The Functions of Magic during the Antonine Plague'. 
I have previously done my Masters in classical archaeology, and my undergrad in anthropology and classics. This past year, I have been working as a humanitarian administrator for Oxfam.
